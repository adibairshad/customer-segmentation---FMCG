# customer-segmentation---FMCG

In this analysis I used CMIE consumer dataset to analyse variables like age, education, expenditure, and category spending.
To cluster the dataset I used unsupervised machine learning algorith "K-Means clustering" to divide the data into clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
I have also to Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduces the data's dimensions by converting it into principal components that capture the most variance.

# Objective 

1. Segment FMCG customers based on demographic characteristics and purchasing patterns.
2. Utilize K-means clustering and PCA to group customers into homogeneous segments and identify key features driving segmentation.
3. Analyze and understand each segmentâ€™s unique traits, preferences, and behaviors, including product preferences and spending habits.

# Conclusion
The analysis identified four distinct customer segments: Balanced Consumers, Affluent Health Enthusiasts, Young Large Families, and Selective Spenders.

Balanced Consumers: Moderate expenditure and balanced consumption across various food items.
Affluent Health Enthusiasts: High expenditure with a preference for fruits and beverages.
Young Large Families: Prioritize dairy consumption, reflecting larger household sizes.
Selective Spenders: Moderate expenditure with a preference for edible oil and dairy products.
